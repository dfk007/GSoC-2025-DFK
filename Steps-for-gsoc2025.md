## Types of Projects

There are **three types of projects**:

1. **Small**
2. **Medium**
3. **Large**

Depending on the size of the project, your work hours and stipend will vary.
 In India:

- Small projects: **$700**
- Medium projects: **$1500**
- Large projects: **$3000**

If converted to Indian rupees, the stipend can go up to **₹2.4 lakhs**, making it very appealing to students. However, your primary goal in preparing for GSoC should not be the stipend but the **opportunity** and **experience** it provides.

GSoC allows you to work on quality projects with experienced developers worldwide, making it a worthwhile endeavor for every college student.

## GSoC Timeline

The GSoC timeline consists of **three important milestones**:

1. **Announcement of Organizations**
	- The organizations and projects participating in GSoC 2025 will be announced at the end of **February**.
	- After the announcement, you will have around a month to study the organizations, understand the projects, and get familiar with their codebases.
2. **Proposal Submission**
	- Proposals act as your resume, showcasing who you are and your plans for the project.
	- You will have time to submit proposals from the end of **March** to early **April**.
3. **Announcement of Contributors**
	- In early **May**, the list of selected contributors will be announced. These individuals will work on GSoC projects.

### Key Highlights

- GSoC is open to students globally.
- Participants work with experienced mentors from organizations worldwide.

**Recommendation:** Start your preparation early, as selected students usually begin months ahead.

## Preparation Roadmap

To succeed in GSoC, focus on the following steps:

### 1. Learn a Programming Language

Start by learning a popular programming language such as:

- **Python**
- **JavaScript**
- **Ruby**
- **PHP**
- **Java**

If you're interested in **C/C++** or fields like **Data Science** or **Machine Learning**, GSoC offers projects in these areas too. Beginners can start with **Python** or **JavaScript** as most GSoC projects use these languages.

### 2. Build Projects

Simply learning syntax isn't enough. Create your own projects to:

- Understand how different technologies are applied.
- Build confidence and experience for contributing to larger open-source projects.

Start small, work on projects that take 1–2 days, and gradually move to more complex ones.

### 3. Learn Version Control

**Version control systems** help track changes to project files over time. Focus on:

- **Git**
- **GitHub**

Understand basics like **branches, commits, pull, and push** commands.
 **Learn Git and GitHub** while working on your projects. For guidance, check this video: [Learn Git and GitHub](https://youtu.be/Ez8F0nW6S-w?si=Y2RYqrraaMI-umHo).

### 4. Gain Open Source Contribution Experience

Read this guide: [Contributing to Open Source](https://www.notedup.in/2024/11/Contributing-to-open-source.html).

Explore GSoC's previous projects here: [GSoC Archive](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2024/organizations).
 Look for issues labeled **"good first issue"** or **"newbie friendly"** to get started.

To stand out, work on **high-impact issues**, such as:

- Adding new features
- Enhancing functionality
- Fixing bugs

Focus on meaningful **pull requests (PRs)**, as minor changes like editing `README.md` won't help.

## GSoC Focus Areas

### 1. Picking an Organization

Analyze organizations that frequently participate in GSoC. Pick **one or two** and contribute months before the official timeline.
 Contributing early helps:

- Showcase your skills
- Build a rapport with the organization
- Gain familiarity with the codebase

Target lesser-known projects to reduce competition.

### 2. Connecting with Maintainers

Engage with maintainers during GSoC, but avoid unnecessary pings. Ask meaningful questions when needed.

### 3. Contributing to Projects

Start contributing meaningfully before GSoC officially begins in February. Early contributions improve your chances of selection, as organizations prefer candidates who are already familiar with their codebases.

## Final Stage: Submitting the Proposal

Once you've followed all preparation steps, submitting the proposal becomes easier and ensures you stand out as a strong candidate.
